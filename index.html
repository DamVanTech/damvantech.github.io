                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Will Hyndman, a student at Nova Scotia Community College in the IT Systems Management and Security program. I'm passionate about technology and am excited to build a career in IT.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I&#39;m an enthusiastic and driven professional currently pursuing a Diploma in IT Systems Management and Security at Nova Scotia Community College. With a growing expertise in networking, system administration, and technical support, I&#39;m focused on building a career in IT while leveraging my diverse background in customer service, food safety, and hands-on maintenance.

                I have hands-on experience working as an Information System Technician with the Nova Scotia Health Authority, where I supported IT infrastructure, managed networks, and provided technical support. In addition to my IT work, I&#39;ve developed valuable customer service skills through various roles at McDonald's, Walmart, and The Wendy's Company, where I honed my ability to engage with customers and manage high-pressure situations effectively.
                
                Whether it's managing a network, assisting customers, or completing mechanical tasks, I pride myself on being adaptable and dedicated to continuous learning. I&#39;m skilled in Windows Server, Active Directory, Python, HTML, and network administration, and am eager to apply my growing technical expertise in a professional setting.</p>
